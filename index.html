            <p>Hello, my name is Christopher and enjoy things that push my creative muscles to the limit. I grew up interested in
              video games and how it worked which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I grew my skills and gained a passion
              for coding. I've learned a lot from university, as well as coding courses that I've taken and my own personal projects/video game
               prototypes. I plan on continuing my coding journey and growing as a programmer and creator.</p>

            <p class="projectPara">This is a simple mail app that allows users to enter their email and it is automatically entered into the database.
            This web app was created using Node.js, and SQL on the backend and Html/Css on the front end.</p>

            <img class="projectPics" src="images/prototype4.gif" alt="">
            <p class="projectPara">This is a wave type platformer that I created. It is wave based as more enemies spawn
            after being knocked off the stage. This was created with C# in the Unity game engine.</p>

    <p class="other">Other projects that I've worked on includes A recipe page for an health advice web app
      that uses the API Spoonacular, created with
    Python, Flask and Jinja2. I have also made various other video game prototypes in Unity with C#, like
    a side view type game where the user avoids obstacles by jumping over them and lasting as long as possible. I recently
    completed a SQL course where I improved my database skills using SQL. I am currently
    working on a virtual reality game for the Oculus Quest 2 using Unity as well. Currently I am taking a web development course,
    where I am improving my skills on the frontend as well as the backend as well as an Unity programming course to
    improve my C# skills.
